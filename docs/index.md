# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors that influenced passenger survival rates in the Titanic disaster using statistical models. The goal is to identify key variables, explore relationships between them, and predict survival outcomes based on these variables.

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Tools Used**: R, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks
- **Statistical Methods**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

## Objectives

1. Understand how passenger demographics (age, gender, class) affected survival rates.
2. Build predictive models to estimate the probability of survival.
3. Interpret the statistical significance of variables.

- [Code and Notebooks](https://github.com/username/titanic-analysis)

## Key Findings

- **Women and children** had a higher survival rate compared to men.
- Passengers from **higher socio-economic classes** had a better chance of survival.
- **Family size** also had an impact on survival, with smaller family groups more likely to survive.

## Future Work

Potential extensions of this analysis include:
- Fine-tuning predictive models using additional variables.
- Exploring survival rates using **more advanced machine learning techniques**.
- Creating interactive dashboards for data exploration.
